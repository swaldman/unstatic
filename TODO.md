# TODO

 - Directory indexes when serving 
   - redirect to slash rather than to index. worth it?
   - https://github.com/softwaremill/tapir/blob/fbe92fdcb60d361fbf99614d7e5f73ca6ed815ef/docs/swagger-ui/src/main/scala/sttp/tapir/swagger/SwaggerUI.scala#L67-L76
 - Better exceptions, search XXX and TODO
 - Add warnings in ZTStaticGen for eg root paths, 
   generableTo links that seem dir like, etc?
 - Speculation: Can we use Mastodon/Fediverse for a comments
   section?
   - Each post a pseudouser people can @ or follow?
   - Maybe each post a hashtag, @ to a common user, 
     comments@interfluidity.com?
