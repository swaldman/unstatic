   they are currently fragile.
 - Better exceptions, search XXX and TODO
 - Fix bad ignore logic in ZTStaticGen
 - Add warnings in ZTStaticGen for eg root paths, 
   generableTo links that seem dir like, etc?
 - Speculation: Can we use Mastodon/Fediverse for a comments
   section?
   - Each post a pseudouser people can @ or follow?
   - Maybe each post a hastag, @ to a common user,
