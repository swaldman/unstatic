# TODO

 - Set up to easily include dashified untemplate fqn as CSS class
 - Flag to auto-open a browser window to site root on
   server startup.
 - Main executable: Be sure to print failure information.
   - Right now, we exit silently (albeit with a failure 
     exit code) when stuff happens
 - Better exceptions, search XXX and TODO
 - Add warnings in ZTStaticGen for eg root paths, 
   generableTo links that seem dir like, etc?
 - Speculation: Can we use Mastodon/Fediverse for a comments
   section?
   - Each post a pseudouser people can @ or follow?
   - Maybe each post a hashtag, @ to a common user, 
     comments@interfluidity.com?
